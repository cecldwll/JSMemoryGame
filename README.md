# Overview

In this project, I developed a simple Memory Game using JavaScript to enhance my understanding of the language and its core features. The goal was to dive deeper into working with the Document Object Model (DOM), event handling, and array manipulation in JavaScript. Additionally, I explored the use of recursion and integrated a popular JavaScript utility library, Lodash, to simplify certain operations such as shuffling an array.

This project was a practical way to demonstrate my knowledge of JavaScript syntax and how it can be applied in real-world applications. By writing this game, I improved my skills in creating dynamic user interfaces and handling user interactions programmatically.

# Development Environment

For this project, I used the following development tools and environment:
- **Code Editor**: Visual Studio Code
- **Browser**: Google Chrome for testing and debugging
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub for tracking changes
- **JavaScript Libraries**: 
   - **Lodash** for utility functions (specifically the `shuffle` function)
   - **HTML/CSS** for structuring and styling the game

The software was developed using **vanilla JavaScript**, leveraging DOM manipulation to create and manage the game's tile elements. The Lodash library was integrated using a CDN for shuffling the array of tile colors.

# Useful Websites

Throughout the project, I found the following websites to be super helpful:
- [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) - JavaScript Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)  
  (Essential for understanding JavaScript functions, DOM manipulation, and event handling.)
- [Lodash Documentation](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15)  
  (A detailed reference for the Lodash utility functions used in this project.)
- [CSS Grid Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)  
  (A comprehensive guide on using CSS Grid to create the tile layout.)
- [What is a content delivery network (CDN)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/#:~:text=A%20content%20delivery%20network%20(CDN)%20is%20a%20geographically%20distributed%20group,stylesheets%2C%20images%2C%20and%20videos.)

# Future Work

There are several improvements and additions I can make:
- Add a **timer** to challenge players to complete the game within a time limit.
- Implement **different levels of difficulty**, with more tiles or less time for harder levels.
- Improve **mobile responsiveness** so the game can be played smoothly on smaller screens.
